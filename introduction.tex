The goal of this project is to ensure the security of the Bay of Biscay by detecting any intruder entering this maritime area.
A group of robots, equipped with GPS, are being used thanks to specific algorythms and a particular monitoring strategy.

\bigskip

In order to proceed with the project, the following working hypotheses are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item The simulation can be done in a two-dimensional world ;
\item Intruders will have a constant given velocity throughout the simulation ;
\item Every surveillance robot has a detection range of $d_{i}$ within which an intruder is necessarily detected ;
\item The safe zones are regarded as a group of rectangles where the intruder can not be.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Two deliverables will be delivered:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first one is a theoretical simulation written to a large extent in Python 3.0 which will allow to determine whether or not the used algorythms are relevant ;
\item The second one is a practical simulation using some buggies robots available in the robotics group of ENSTA Bretagne.
\end{itemize}
